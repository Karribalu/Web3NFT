# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:
## add your own
POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_URL
POLYGON_API_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY ( Wallet )
POLYGON_SCAN_API_KEY 
add 
```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run --network NETWORK_NAME scripts/deploy.ts
```
