# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:
## add your own
POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_URL <br>
POLYGON_API_KEY <br>
PRIVATE_KEY ( Wallet ) <br>
POLYGON_SCAN_API_KEY<br>
in .env file
```shell
npm init
npm install
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run --network NETWORK_NAME scripts/deploy.ts
```
